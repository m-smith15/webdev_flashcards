# WebDev Flashcards
Welcome to WebDev Flashcards! The origins of this project are to help aspiring or current developers brush up on concepts, theories, or jargon commonly used in web development.<br/>
This project is in its infancy and will be continuously evolving and growing. If you’re a developer (of <b>ANY</b> skill level) who’d like to get involved then check out the ‘Getting Involved’ section. <br/><br/>
You can view and practice your knowledge via: https://webdev-flashcards.vercel.app/. Feel free to explore and let us know what you think!!

## Where did we get this idea from
Following graduation from Coding Dojo’s coding bootcamp and attempting to enter the industry, I felt that while my hard coding skills were up to par, some of my knowledge around theories or terminology was lacking. I thought to myself:  “What better way to remedy this, than to build an application to solve this problem!”

When I mentioned the idea to Coren, the idea resonated with him as well. We immediately started collaborating to get the groundwork deployed to a (free) publicly available site and begin work on building out the flashcard database so we can be more well rounded developers.

## Getting Involved
If you’d like to get involved in helping to build out this application, then reach out to Mack or Coren on LinkedIn by sending either of us a message. To give you an idea of what collaboration looks like -
 * We primarily collaborate through Discord when stuck on a problem, find new tech to utilize, or just want to say "hi".
 * We plan to meet weekly for 30-45 minutes on Wednesday. The purpose is to discuss and document protocols and standards we'd like to implement for various processes. 
 * We have a ZERO commitment policy. Meaning if you like to start contributing, there is no pressure to remain actively contributing! 
 * Regardless of skill level, we’d love to have you join in any capacity! 
You can find instructions on how to make contributions in the makingcontributions.md file, or via this [link](https://github.com/m-smith15/webdev_flashcards/blob/master/makingcontributions.md)

## Technologies Used
This project is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, React) and is hosted publicly on Vercel.
The database of flashcards is community built and maintained.

## Setup
This is a MERN stack application, so the dependencies are located in the package.json files.<br/>
This project is actually utilizing 2 deployments on Vercel currently. One to handle the frontend and another deployment to handle the backend. <br/> 
(Client folder == frontend | Server folder == backend)<br/>
<!-- TODO: Will describe process to fork and run locally once the dev | | localhost feature is added to project -->

## Room for Improvement
  - We have a running google doc of things we’re working on, and features we’d like to implement in the future. <br/> You can view that google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCxL-ObpanxA-0_K81IMbNgWlwDwPS5SKxNcyhSYlw0/edit).

## Acknowledgements
- A huge thank-you to [Coren](https://github.com/coren-frankel) for his help with the Vercel deployment!!
  - Coren's project [LookAchoo](https://github.com/coren-frankel/LookAchoo) was deployed in a similar manner to this one, and was a big inspiration in the decisions to deploy on Vercel
- A big thank you to Vercel for providing such a valuable service for free! Check Vercel out for your projects [here](https://vercel.com/)!
